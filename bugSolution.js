The solution depends on the specific cause of the error, but here's a general approach:

1. **Examine the error message carefully:** While often vague, the message might hint at the problematic module or dependency.
2. **Verify your dependencies:** Ensure that all modules and libraries are compatible with your current Expo SDK version.  Use `expo upgrade` to ensure everything is up-to-date.
3. **Check for Expo-compatible alternatives:** Many native modules have Expo equivalents. Replace direct native module imports with Expo-provided alternatives.
4. **If using a native module:**  Thoroughly investigate whether the module has explicit support for Expo. Look for documentation or examples showing how to integrate it with Expo. If it doesn't have Expo support, assess the feasibility of using the module in a detached workflow instead.  This is more complex as it involves ejecting your project from Expo's managed workflow.
5. **Simplify:** If the error appeared after introducing a new module or making changes, revert these changes to pinpoint the source of the problem.
6. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` can clear out temporary files and resolve build problems.
7. **Community Support:** Seek assistance on the Expo forums or GitHub community. Provide details about the error and your project setup.

Example (Illustrative Solution using Expo APIs instead of a problematic native module):

```javascript
// Instead of this (if MyNativeModule is problematic):
// import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
// const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

// ... use MyNativeModule ...

// Consider using a suitable Expo API (example):
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';

// Use FileSystem API for file operations instead of MyNativeModule
```
