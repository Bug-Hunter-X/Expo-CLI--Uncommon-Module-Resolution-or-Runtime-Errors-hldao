This error typically occurs when you try to import a module or component that Expo doesn't support directly, or when there's a mismatch in the versions of Expo modules or dependencies in your project.  A common scenario is using a native module that hasn't been properly configured for Expo's managed workflow.  The error message might not explicitly point to the source but manifest as a general module resolution failure or a runtime error during app startup.

Example (Illustrative):

```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native'; // Problematic if the native module isn't Expo-compatible

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

// ... use MyNativeModule ...
```
