# Expo CLI: Uncommon Module Resolution or Runtime Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose issue in Expo CLI projects: failures related to module resolution or runtime errors that stem from unsupported native modules or dependency version conflicts.  The error messages themselves aren't always descriptive, leading to confusion in troubleshooting.

## Problem

When working with Expo's managed workflow, attempts to use native modules directly (without proper Expo integration or compatibility) can result in cryptic error messages.  Version inconsistencies between Expo modules and other dependencies can trigger similar problems.

## Solution

The solution involves careful review of the project's dependencies and usage of native modules. It emphasizes using Expo's supported APIs and libraries wherever possible or following specific instructions if working with community-maintained native modules.  If a native module is essential, explore whether an Expo-compatible version exists or if it's feasible to implement the necessary functionality using Expo's APIs.
